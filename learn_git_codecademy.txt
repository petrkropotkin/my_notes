  git init ==> initialize Working directory/creates a new Git repository

  git status ==> inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
  
A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:
1)A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
2)A Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory
3)A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

  git add filename ==> adds files from the working directory to the staging area
  git diff filename ==> shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area 
  git commit -m "some info about commit" ==> permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
  git log ==> shows a list of all previous commits //a SHA,the commit author,the date and time of the commit,the commit message

git show HEAD  ?

3 different ways to backtrack in Git:
  git checkout HEAD filename ==> Discards changes in the working directory.
  git reset HEAD filename ==> Unstages file changes in the staging area
  git reset commit_SHA(the first 7 characters) ==> Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.

3_GIT BRANCHING
Git branching allows users to experiment with different versions of a project
by checking out separate branches to work on

  git branch ==> Lists all a Git project's branches.
  git branch branch_name ==> Creates a new branch.
  git checkout branch_name ==> Used to switch from one branch to another.
  git merge branch_name ==> Used to join file changes from one branch to another

merge conflict:
<<<<<<< HEAD
master version of line
=======
fencing version of line
>>>>>>> fencing

  git branch -d branch_name ==> Deletes the branch specified.

4_GIT TEAMWORK
git clone remote_location clone_name
 remote_location --> tells Git where to go to find the remote. This could be a web address, or a filepath, such as:
 /Users/teachers/Documents/some-remote
 clone_name --> is the name you give to the directory in which Git will clone the repository.
git remote -v
git fetch
git merge origin/master
